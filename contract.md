Communication:
    1. Team Meetings: We will have weekly team meetings on Monday from 5:00PM CST to 8:00 PM CST and Wednesday from 6:00 PM CST to 8:00 PM CST. We will meet on Discord and keep a shared folder on Google Drive to store/share information amongst ourselves.
    2. Assistance: We have a Discord chat, and teammates can ask questions. The expected response
    time to inquires will be an hour. If it's longer than that, contact by email or further direct
    messaging can be used.
    3. Respect: We will each try our best to listen to each other with respect. However, design decisions can be accpted by simple majority - while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. Each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

Collaboration
    1. Work Distribution: Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned the task by a random name generator. After a random duo is generated, the other duo will take over the next time that nobody volunteers for a task so we can alternate.
    2. Time Commitment: Each member is expected to work no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication.
    3. Conflict Resolution: When design conflicts arise between two members of the group, they will try to come to a compromise themselves. If a compromise is not reached, they will contact the other two members and we will try to work out the problem as an entire group. If necessary, we will appeal to the TA for advice.
